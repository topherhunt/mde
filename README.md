# MDE (Markdown Editor)

A simple WYSIWYG Markdown browser/editor for macOS. Open a folder of `.md` files, edit them visually with a toolbar, and save back to Markdown. Features tabbed editing, file explorer sidebar, document outline, find/replace, syntax-highlighted code blocks, file conflict detection, dark mode, and PDF export.

Inspired by this guy's MDV app: https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2026/05/12/emacsification/.

## Getting started

```
npm install
npm start
```

Drag a folder onto the window to open it as a project, or use File > Open.

### Terminal launcher

Open Settings (Cmd+,) and click "Install terminal launcher" to enable opening folders from the terminal:

```
mde .              # Open current directory
mde ~/my-notes     # Open a specific folder
```

## Tests

```
npm test
```

Runs headless Playwright E2E tests against a packaged build.

## Dev & test caveats

- In dev and test, dragging files/folders onto the dock app icon doesn't work. You need to manually test on the packaged app.
- In test, dragging files/folders into the app window doesn't work AFAICT. The tests skip this step and simulate triggering the drop, meaning potential bug space.

## Build & distribute

```
npm run make
```

Produces a distributable `.app` (macOS) in the `out/make/` directory.
